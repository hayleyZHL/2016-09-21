Plans for this lecture are:

- introduce concept of "random variable" in slightly more generality and with more explanation than the textbook does, including the concept of "distribution" which the textbook does not really define.
- introduce "discrete" random variable and generic properties, with examples

For those who like to read ahead in the book, you could read 2.1 up to 2.1.3 possibly, but my introduction will be a bit different.

I will "re-converge" with the textbook soon enough.
